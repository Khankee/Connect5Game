Yes it is. This is Connect 5 (not 4) game. 
The rules are simple:
* Players must connect 5 of the same colored discs in a row to win.
* Only one piece is played at a time.
* Players can be on the offensive or defensive.
* The game ends when there is a 5-in-a-row or a stalemate.
* The starter of the previous game goes second on the next game.

To try this game on your PC (or laptop)
* First, clone (or download this repo)
* Open your IDE with Java library (Yes, the game runs on Java language. I have used old Java.Swing GUI Framework )
* Second, run mainclass.java
* Congratulations! You just opened the menu bar of the game.

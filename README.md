The rules are simple:
- Players must connect 5 of the same colored discs in a row to win.
- Only one piece is played at a time.
- Players can be on the offensive or defensive.
- The game ends when there is a 5-in-a-row or a stalemate.
- The starter of the previous game goes second on the next game.
